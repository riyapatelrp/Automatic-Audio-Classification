# Audio classification of Dogs and Cats
ASR is the audio counterpart of the famous "cats and dogs" audio classification task using Python, ML and DL. You can have a visual description of the Wave here. The main aim of this project is to create a model that can distinguish between a dog’s sound to a cat’s sound with Deep Learning algorithm.

Dataset: The dataset consists many “wav” files for both the cat and dog classes:
• 150+ wav files of cat meowing
• 100+ wav files of dog barking

### What is Librosa ?
• Librosa is a python package for music and audio analysis.

• It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.

### What is Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) ?
• In sound processing, the Mel-frequency cepstrum is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound, based on a linear cosine transform of a log power spectrum on a nonlinear Mel scale of frequency. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are coefficients that collectively make up an MFC.

• MFCCs are the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. MFCC takes into account human perception for sensitivity at appropriate frequencies by converting the conventional frequency to Mel Scale, and are thus suitable for speech recognition tasks quite well.

• Mel Scale: The Mel scale is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another. It relates perceived frequency, or pitch, of a pure tone to its actual measured frequency.

• Zero Crossing Rate: The zero-crossing rate (ZCR) is the rate at which a signal changes from positive to zero to negative or from negative to zero to positive.
